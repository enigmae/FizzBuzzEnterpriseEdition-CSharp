# SourceThis is a port of a popular coding sample from the Java world, "Fizz Buzz Enterprise Edition". The original Java source, from which much can be learned about enterprise software development, can be found here: https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition# FizzBuzzEnterpriseEditionEnterprise software marks a special high-grade class of software that makescareful use of relevant software architecture design principles to buildparticularly customizable and extensible solutions to real problems. Thisproject is an example of how the popular FizzBuzz game might be built were itsubject to the high quality standards of enterprise software.## FizzBuzzFizzBuzz is a game that has gained in popularity as a programming assignment toweed out non-programmers during job interviews. The object of the assignment isless about solving it correctly according to the below rules and more aboutshowing the programmer understands basic, necessary tools such as`if`-/`else`-statements and loops. The rules of FizzBuzz are as follows:For numbers 1 through 100,* if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;* if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;* else, print the number.### Please noteBecause I know some people out there will get the wrong end of the stick: this is a joke, but it's only funny because there are real world examples of software written like this.
